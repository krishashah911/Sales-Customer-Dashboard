# Sales-Customer-Dashboard

## Tableau projects📊are like building houses🏘.

### It requires a set of steps before you start building actual graphs and dashboards. I have been using Tableau for more than 2 years now and I still come up with different methods each time. 

### Presenting my new Sales-Customer Dashboard https://lnkd.in/dEUQ2QSN which resembles closely to any real-time company's project. Here are a few key steps to follow that will make your next dashboard clean, efficient and engaging.

Step 1: Analyse Requirements
Sit with the stakeholders and understand their requirements/wishes. Chose the right charts, draw mockups and get them approved by the users. Choose a maximum of 4 colors throughout the dashboard. Two base colors and rest usually based on the company's logo colors. 

Step 2: Build Data Sources
Connect data, create data models, rename fields and tables, check data types and finally understand data.

Step 3: Build Charts
Now comes the actual building part. Create calculated fields and check the numbers using tables. Later build charts, formatting by removing lines and grids, clean-up axis and headers, coloring, tooltips.

Step 4: Build Dashboard
We shall again draw mockups for containers. Create container structure, pull all charts together and start formatting by distributing objects evenly. Fit entire view, add legends, padding, filters and lastly icons.
